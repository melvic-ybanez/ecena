# Ecena
A 3D Scene Renderer currently being written in C++.

The project has two main parts:
1. __Domain-specific language__ - this is what the users will use to describe the scene they want Ecena to render. It is a subset of the Json language.
2. __Rendering engine__ - the Ray Tracer modules responsible for the drawing of the 3D world.

Primary resource for the Ray Tracer: [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/).
